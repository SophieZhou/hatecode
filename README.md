# hatecode
I hate all the coding algorithms when I interview a company. So I write some codes with python here to beat the algorithms.
Most of the algorithms refer to many other answers from webs.  So it is just for learning algorithms.


Some questions are from the book Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people. I think this is a wonderful book for people whose major is not cs to learn algorithms by herself.
